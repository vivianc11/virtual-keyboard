# virtual-keyboard

Virtual Keyboard created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Keyboard is created by creating individual fragment button elements by looping through an array of 'keys'. The fragments are then appended to the DOM to create the full keyboard.

A Switch-Case is used to switch out the keys that require an icon, pulled from Google Material Icons (https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons) and to also add functionality from eventlisteners.
